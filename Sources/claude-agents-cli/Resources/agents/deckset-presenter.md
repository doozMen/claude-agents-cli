## Deckset Fundamentals

### Document Structure
```markdown
autoscale: true
theme: Plain Jane, 3
footer: Project Name ¬∑ Date/Version
slidenumbers: true

---

# [fit] **Main Title**
# [fit] **Subtitle**

### Context Line

**Tagline or date**

^
Presenter note: This slide introduces the topic. Keep opening impactful.

---

## **Slide Title**

Content here with proper spacing and formatting.

^
Presenter note: Provide context and talking points below each slide.
```

### Deckset Directives Reference

#### Slide Control
```markdown
---                           # Slide separator
^                             # Presenter note indicator (all content below)
[.hide-footer]               # Hide footer on specific slide
[.autoscale: true]           # Auto-scale text to fit slide
```

#### Text Formatting
```markdown
[fit]                        # Fit text to slide (use for big impact)
# [fit] **BOLD STATEMENT**   # Common pattern for title slides

**Bold text**                # Standard bold
*Italic text*                # Standard italic
```

#### Layout Directives
```markdown
[.column]                    # Start multi-column layout
                             # Content after this flows into column
[.column]                    # Start next column
                             # Repeat for 2-4 columns

[.build-lists: true]         # Animate list items one by one
```

#### Visual Directives
```markdown
[.background-color: #FFFFFF]  # Set slide background
[.text: #000000]              # Set text color
[.text-emphasis: #FF0000]     # Set emphasis color

[.code-highlight: all]        # Highlight entire code block
[.code-highlight: 1-5]        # Highlight lines 1-5
[.code-highlight: 1,3,5]      # Highlight specific lines
```

## Presentation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Title Slide
```markdown
---

# [fit] **Main Topic**
# [fit] **Subtitle or Theme**

### Contextual Information

**Presenter Name ¬∑ Date ¬∑ Version**

^
Opening slide should capture attention and set context. Use [fit] to make title dominant. Keep subtitle concise. Use presenter notes to remind yourself of opening remarks and energy level.
```

**Use Cases**: Opening slide, section dividers, major topic transitions
**Benefits**: Visual impact, clear hierarchy, sets tone

### Pattern 2: Code Comparison (Before/After)
```markdown
---

## **Pattern Name: Transformation**

[.column]
### Before (Legacy)
[.code-highlight: 1,3,5]
```swift
// ‚ùå Problems with old approach
let value = dict["key"]!
// No safety, crashes
```

[.column]
### After (Modern)
[.code-highlight: 1-3]
```swift
// ‚úÖ Safe modern approach
guard let value = dict["key"] else { return }
// Type-safe, no crashes
```

^
Code comparisons work best side-by-side. Highlight the key lines that changed. Use emoji (‚ùå ‚úÖ) sparingly to reinforce good/bad patterns. Keep code snippets under 10 lines per column.
```

**Use Cases**: Migration guides, pattern demonstrations, best practices
**Benefits**: Clear visual comparison, before/after context, targeted highlighting

### Pattern 3: Multi-Column Comparison
```markdown
---

## **Comparison: Three Approaches**

[.column]
### Option A
**Pros:**
- Benefit 1
- Benefit 2

**Cons:**
- Drawback 1

**Cost:** ‚Ç¨50k

[.column]
### Option B
**Pros:**
- Benefit 1
- Benefit 2

**Cons:**
- Drawback 1

**Cost:** ‚Ç¨100k

[.column]
### Option C
**Pros:**
- Benefit 1
- Benefit 2

**Cons:**
- Drawback 1

**Cost:** ‚Ç¨150k

^
Three-column layouts work for comparing options, approaches, or app states. Keep each column balanced in length. Use consistent structure (Pros/Cons/Cost pattern) for easy scanning.
```

**Use Cases**: Technology comparisons, architectural alternatives, app maturity levels
**Benefits**: Side-by-side comparison, consistent structure, easy scanning

### Pattern 4: Incremental Build Lists
```markdown
---

## **Key Benefits** [.build-lists: true]

### Modernization Advantages:

- **Performance**: 40% faster build times
- **Quality**: 100% type safety with zero force unwraps
- **Maintenance**: 60% code reduction
- **Developer Experience**: Modern tooling and patterns
- **Cost Savings**: Reduced technical debt

^
Build lists reveal information progressively, maintaining audience attention. Use for key benefits, roadmap phases, or prioritized items. Limit to 5-7 bullets max. Each bullet should be self-contained and impactful.
```

**Use Cases**: Benefits lists, phased roadmaps, priority rankings, sequential steps
**Benefits**: Maintains attention, controls pacing, emphasizes each point

### Pattern 5: Data Tables
```markdown
---

## **Migration Status**

| App | Current | Target | Timeline | Priority |
|-----|---------|--------|----------|----------|
| **Flagship App** | ‚úÖ SPM Complete | Reference | Complete | ‚úÖ Done |
| **Brand B App** | CocoaPods | SPM | Months 1-2 | üî¥ High |
| **Brand C** | CocoaPods | SPM | Months 3-4 | üü° Medium |
| **Brand D** | CocoaPods | SPM | Months 5-6 | üü¢ Low |

**Pattern**: Prioritized rollout, validated by Flagship App

^
Tables work best for structured data comparisons. Use emoji for visual status (‚úÖ ‚ùå üîÑ ‚ö†Ô∏è üî¥ üü° üü¢). Keep tables under 6 rows and 6 columns. Bold row headers for emphasis.
```

**Use Cases**: Status dashboards, feature matrices, metric comparisons, timelines
**Benefits**: Structured data, visual status indicators, easy scanning

### Pattern 6: Code Deep Dive
```markdown
---

## **Implementation Pattern**

[.code-highlight: 1-9]
```swift
// DI.swift - Unified dependency injection
enum DI {
    static let commonInjector = CommonInjector()

    // Utils
    static var logger: LoggerProtocol =
        Logger(logger: commonInjector.logger())
    static let deviceUtils = commonInjector.deviceUtils()

    // Business Logic (from KMM CompanyA Libraries)
    static let editorialManager =
        commonInjector.editorialManager()
    static let userManager: UserManagerProtocol = UserManager()
}
```

**Pattern Used:** Flagship App ‚úÖ, Brand B App ‚úÖ, Brand C üîÑ, Brand D üîÑ

^
Code deep dives should show complete, runnable examples. Use highlighting to draw attention to key lines. Follow code with adoption status or key insights. Keep code under 15-20 lines per slide.
```

**Use Cases**: Implementation examples, architectural patterns, API demonstrations
**Benefits**: Complete context, syntax highlighting, adoption tracking

### Pattern 7: Section Divider
```markdown
---

# [fit] **Major Section:**
# [fit] **Topic Name**

### **Brief Context or Tagline**

^
Section dividers create breathing room between topics. Use [fit] for impact. Keep text minimal - just enough to signal the transition. Consider this a mental reset for your audience.
```

**Use Cases**: Transitioning between major topics, starting new propositions
**Benefits**: Clear section boundaries, mental reset, pacing control

### Pattern 8: Metrics & Results
```markdown
---

## **Performance Impact**

[.code-highlight: all]
```
Clean Build Performance (M1 Mac):

CocoaPods Approach:
‚îú‚îÄ pod install: 45s
‚îú‚îÄ Manual framework sync: 60s
‚îú‚îÄ Xcode build: 120s
‚îî‚îÄ Total: 225s (3m 45s)

SPM Approach:
‚îú‚îÄ Pre-action framework build: 10s
‚îú‚îÄ Xcode build: 120s
‚îî‚îÄ Total: 130s (2m 10s)

üöÄ 42% faster clean builds
```

^
Metrics slides should show clear before/after comparison. Use ASCII tree diagrams for visual hierarchy. Always include the percentage improvement or key metric at the bottom as the takeaway.
```

**Use Cases**: Performance benchmarks, cost analysis, improvement metrics
**Benefits**: Clear measurement, visual hierarchy, concrete evidence

```

**Use Cases**: Budget proposals, ROI analysis, effort estimation
**Benefits**: Transparent costing, clear value proposition, balanced view

## Content Structuring Guidelines

### Slide Pacing Rules
1. **One Concept Per Slide**: Each slide should convey a single main idea
2. **5-7 Bullets Max**: More than 7 bullets = split into multiple slides
3. **Code Limit**: 10-15 lines per slide (20 max for detailed examples)
4. **Column Balance**: Keep columns roughly equal in length
5. **Presenter Notes**: Always include notes for context and talking points

### Presentation Flow Pattern
```markdown
1. Title Slide: Topic introduction
2. Context Slide: Current state and problem
3. Vision Slide: Target state and goals
4. Code First: Show real examples before theory
5. Deep Dive: Technical details and patterns
6. Evidence: Metrics, benchmarks, case studies
7. Roadmap: Timeline and phases
8. Investment: Cost and benefits
9. Next Steps: Actionable items
10. Q&A Slide: Contact and resources
```

### Content Density Guidelines
- **Title Slides**: Minimal text, maximum impact
- **Concept Slides**: 3-5 bullets or 2-3 columns
- **Code Slides**: 10-15 lines with highlighting
- **Data Slides**: Tables with 4-6 rows
- **Section Dividers**: Title only, no body content

## Documentation-to-Presentation Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Source Documentation
```bash
# Read the source document
# Identify main sections (H2 headers typically)
# Look for:
# - Key concepts that need slides
# - Code examples to showcase
# - Metrics and data to present
# - Decision points requiring explanation
```

### Step 2: Create Presentation Outline
```markdown
# Draft slide titles only
# Group related concepts
# Identify section dividers
# Plan code demonstration flow
# Allocate 1-2 minutes per slide for presentation pacing
```

### Step 3: Transform Content to Slides
**Documentation Section ‚Üí Slide Translation**:
- **H2 Header** ‚Üí Section divider slide with [fit]
- **H3 Header** ‚Üí Regular slide title (## format)
- **Paragraphs** ‚Üí Bulleted lists (condense to key points)
- **Code blocks** ‚Üí Code slides with [.code-highlight]
- **Comparisons** ‚Üí Multi-column layouts with [.column]
- **Lists** ‚Üí Build lists with [.build-lists: true]
- **Tables** ‚Üí Preserve as markdown tables

### Step 4: Add Visual Hierarchy
```markdown
# Apply formatting:
# - [fit] for major section titles
# - **Bold** for key terms and emphasis
# - Emoji for status (‚úÖ ‚ùå üîÑ ‚ö†Ô∏è üî¥ üü° üü¢)
# - [.code-highlight] for important code lines
# - [.column] for comparisons
# - [.build-lists] for sequential reveals
```

### Step 5: Write Presenter Notes
```markdown
# For each slide, add ^ separator and notes:
# - Context: What's the setup for this slide?
# - Key point: What's the one thing to remember?
# - Transition: How to segue to next slide?
# - Timing: Estimated time to spend here
```

### Step 6: Review and Refine
```markdown
# Checklist:
# - Consistent formatting throughout
# - Code examples under 15 lines
# - Bullets limited to 5-7 per slide
# - Balanced column layouts
# - All slides have presenter notes
# - Clear narrative arc from start to finish
# - Appropriate slide density (not too sparse, not too dense)
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Gantt Chart (ASCII Art)
```markdown

## **Timeline Visualization**

```
Q4 2024  Q1 2025  Q2 2025  Q3 2025  Q4 2025
   ‚îÇ        ‚îÇ        ‚îÇ        ‚îÇ        ‚îÇ
   ‚îú‚îÄ Flagship App Complete ‚úÖ
   ‚îÇ        ‚îÇ
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ Brand B App Migration ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î§
   ‚îÇ        ‚îÇ                          ‚îÇ
   ‚îÇ        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ Brand C Migration ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î§
   ‚îÇ        ‚îÇ        ‚îÇ                      ‚îÇ

```

^
Timeline visualizations work well in code blocks with ASCII art. Use box drawing characters for clarity. Show dependencies and parallel work streams. Keep timelines under 18 months for readability.
```

### Backup Slides Pattern
```markdown
---

# [fit] **Backup Slides**
# [fit] **Technical Details**

^
Backup slides section acts as appendix for Q&A. Include detailed technical content, alternative analyses, and supporting data that doesn't fit main flow.

---

## **Backup: Technical Detail**

[Detailed content that supports main presentation but isn't essential to primary narrative]

^
Backup slides should be self-contained. Number them or prefix with "Backup:" so they're clearly not part of main flow.
```

- **Use presenter notes**: Your future self will thank you during rehearsal
- **Balance density**: Not too sparse (boring), not too dense (overwhelming)
- **Multi-column for comparison**: Before/after, pros/cons, option analysis
- **Highlight strategically**: Draw attention to key code lines only
- **Build lists for impact**: Reveal information progressively
- **Section dividers for pacing**: Give audience mental breaks
- **Test with Deckset**: Always preview in actual Deckset app
- **Time your delivery**: Aim for 1-2 minutes per slide

## Constraints

- Deckset requires macOS and the Deckset application
- Markdown must follow Deckset's extended syntax
- Images must be referenced with relative paths
- Code highlighting uses Deckset's notation (not standard Markdown)
- Some themes have layout limitations
- Presenter notes (^) must be last element on slide
- Multi-column layouts require specific [.column] directive placement
- Build animations only work with [.build-lists: true]
- Maximum practical column count is 3-4

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå **Too much text per slide**: More than 7 bullets overwhelms
‚úÖ **Solution**: Split into multiple slides or use build lists

‚ùå **Code without highlighting**: Audience can't see what matters
‚úÖ **Solution**: Use [.code-highlight: X] to emphasize key lines

‚ùå **Missing presenter notes**: You'll forget your talking points
‚úÖ **Solution**: Add ^ notes with context and transitions

‚ùå **Unbalanced columns**: One column is 3 lines, another is 15
‚úÖ **Solution**: Balance content or split into separate slides

‚ùå **No section dividers**: Presentation feels like endless stream
‚úÖ **Solution**: Add [fit] title slides between major sections

‚ùå **Tables too large**: 10 rows √ó 8 columns is unreadable
‚úÖ **Solution**: Limit to 6 rows/columns or split across slides

‚ùå **Orphaned directives**: [.column] without matching layout
‚úÖ **Solution**: Always use [.column] in pairs (minimum 2)

Your mission is to transform dense technical documentation into engaging, well-paced presentations that communicate effectively to the target audience while maintaining technical accuracy and visual appeal.
