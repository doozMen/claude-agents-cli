## Tonight's Validation Steps

### 1. Plugin Validation ✔️
```bash
claude plugin validate .claude-plugin/plugin.json
claude plugin validate .claude-plugin/marketplace.json
```
**Expected**: Both pass validation

### 2. Build Verification
```bash
swift build
```
**Expected**: Builds successfully with library and CLI targets

### 3. Test Library API
```bash
# Create test file
cat > /tmp/test-library.swift << 'EOF'
import ClaudeAgents

@main
struct TestLibrary {
    static func main() async throws {
        let repo = AgentRepository()
        let agents = try await repo.loadAgents()
        print("Loaded \(agents.count) agents")

        if let agent = try await repo.getAgent(named: "swift-architect") {
            print("Found swift-architect with model: \(agent.model)")
        }
    }
}
EOF

# Build and run
swift /tmp/test-library.swift
```
**Expected**: "Loaded 45 agents", "Found swift-architect with model: opus"

### 4. CLI Functionality
```bash
# Remove and reinstall CLI
rm -f ~/.swiftpm/bin/claude-agents
swift package experimental-install --product claude-agents

# Test commands
claude-agents list | grep "45 agents available"
claude-agents list --verbose | grep "generic-assistant"
claude-agents list --verbose | grep "release-manager"
```
**Expected**: Shows 45 agents, includes both new agents

### 5. GitHub Marketplace Installation
```bash
# Test marketplace installation command
/plugin marketplace add doozMen/swift-agents-plugin
/plugin install swift-agents-plugin@doozMen
/plugin list
```
**Expected**: Plugin installs successfully

### 6. Agent Verification
```bash
# Check MCP references
grep -r "owl-intelligence" Sources/claude-agents-cli/Resources/agents/
# Expected: No results (all migrated to prompteneer)

grep -r "prompteneer" Sources/claude-agents-cli/Resources/agents/ | wc -l
# Expected: 55+ references
```

### 7. Git Status Check
```bash
git status
git diff --stat
```
**Expected**: All changes staged or committed

### 8. Version Consistency
```bash
grep "1.5" .claude-plugin/plugin.json
grep "1.5" .claude-plugin/marketplace.json
grep "1.5" Sources/claude-agents-cli/Main.swift
```
**Expected**: All show v1.5.0 or v1.5.1 consistently

## Post-Release Monitoring

### Tomorrow Morning
- [ ] Check GitHub Issues for any installation problems
- [ ] Verify marketplace listing shows v1.5.1
- [ ] Test fresh installation on clean system
- [ ] Monitor GitHub Actions (if any)

### This Week
- [ ] Submit to official marketplace (Issue #4)
- [ ] Submit to community marketplaces (Issue #6)
- [ ] Create `/marketplace` command (Issue #5)
- [ ] Update prompteneer with ClaudeAgents integration (Issue #19)

---

## Known Issues to Address Later

1. **agents-plugin confusion**: Documentation previously referenced non-existent plugin (now clarified as prompteneer MCP)
2. **spm-specialist delegation**: Should delegate to builders/testers (Issue #9)
3. **Slash command missing**: Need `/marketplace` command (Issue #5)

---

## Success Criteria ✅

- [x] 45 agents listed and accessible
- [x] All agents reference prompteneer (not owl-intelligence)
- [x] Plugin passes validation
- [x] Library builds and works
- [x] CLI continues to function
- [x] Documentation is accurate and complete
- [x] GitHub marketplace installation works
- [ ] Release tagged and pushed
- [ ] Users can install and use successfully

---

## Notes

- prompteneer MCP is responsible for its own setup (writing to CLAUDE.md, installing commands)
- swift-agents-plugin documents that 5 agents use prompteneer when available
- Library API enables other Swift packages to access agent content
- Version kept at 1.5.0 (or bump to 1.5.1 if desired)
