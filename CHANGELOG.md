## [1.2.2] - 2025-10-14

### Fixed
- **azure-devops-specialist-template**: Fixed critical markdown escaping bug in work item comments
  - **Root Cause**: Azure CLI `--discussion` parameter triple-escapes markdown characters (e.g., `\#` â†’ `\\\#`), rendering comments as broken raw text in Azure DevOps UI
  - **Impact**: Comments would display as `\\## Header` instead of formatted headers
  - **Solution**: Use `az devops invoke` with JSON files instead of `--discussion` parameter to bypass escaping bug

  - Added draft MR status checking commands
  - Improved draft MR use case descriptions

## [1.2.1] - 2025-10-14

- **Azure CLI Dependency Support**: Added azure-cli to predefined CLIDependency list
  - Dependency ID: `azure-cli`
  - Check command: `which az`
  - Homebrew formula: `azure-cli`

### Changed

### Behavior
- **Default Behavior**: After installing agents with dependencies, CLI checks for missing tools and prompts to install
